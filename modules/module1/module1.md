## Module 1 - Python Programming Fundamentals üêç

In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of programming using Python. We will begin with an introduction to the language, followed by setting up the development environment. Key topics will include variables, data types, operators, and control flow structures. We will also cover functions and modularity, as well as essential data structures. Additionally, we will delve into functional programming concepts. To consolidate your understanding, we will conclude with a comprehensive exercise that integrates all the topics covered in this module.
